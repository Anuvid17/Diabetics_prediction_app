<b>Project Description:</b> Diabetes Prediction Web Application <hr> 
<h4><b></b>Overview</h4></b>
The Diabetes Prediction Web Application figures out how likely patients are to get diabetes using machine learning. Developers built it with the Flask framework for the web interface SQLite to manage the database, and a trained machine learning model to make accurate predictions. <hr>
<h4><b>Objectives</b></h4> <hr>
i) To offer an easy-to-use interface for users to enter health information. <br>
ii) To keep user data safe using SQLite. <br>
iii) To use a trained machine learning model to predict diabetes risk based on what users enter. <br>
iv) To give users predictions and insights right away. <br> <hr>
<h4><b>Features</b></h4> <br> <hr>
<b>i)Easy-to-Use Interface:</b> <br>
a) Simple web interface created with Flask. <br>
b) Forms to enter important health information (like age, BMI, blood pressure, glucose levels). <br>
<b>ii) Database Management:</b> <br>
a) SQLite database to store what users enter and the prediction results. <br>
b) Safe handling of user data with encryption and privacy steps. <br>
<b>iii) Machine Learning Integration:</b> <br>
a) Machine learning model trained in advance to figure out diabetes risk. <br>
b) Joining forces with the web app to give quick predictions. <br>
<b>iv) Real-time Prediction:</b> <br>
a) Quick answers to users based on what they put in. <br>
b) Showing prediction outcomes and maybe suggesting they talk to a doctor. <br> <hr>
<h4><b>Technology Stack</b></h4> <br> <hr>
<b>i) Backend:</b> Flask powers the web server. <br>
<b>ii) Database:</b> SQLite holds user info. <br>
<b>iii) Machine Learning:</b> Ready-to-use model built with tools like Scikit-Learn or TensorFlow. <br>
<b>iv) Frontend:</b> HTML, CSS, and JavaScript create lively web pages. <br> <hr>
<h4><b>Architecture</b></h4> <br> <hr>
<b>i) Frontend:</b> HTML forms let users input data. JavaScript checks forms and talks to the server without reloading (AJAX). <br>
<b>ii) Backend:</b> Flask handles what comes in and goes out. SQLite works with the system to save and grab user details. The system loads the machine learning model and makes predictions. <br>
<b>iii) Machine Learning:</b> The model learns from a diabetes dataset (like the PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset). Joblib or pickle packs up the model so it's ready to use. <br> <hr>
